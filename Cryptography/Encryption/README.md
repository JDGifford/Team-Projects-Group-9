# Encryption algorithm script
- The encryption script works by renaming all images in scripts parent folder + "\images" according to the naming convention ingested by the webserver. It will then compress the images directory to a zip file named images.zip. The compresses file is then encrypted using the symmetric cipher key (aes_key.bin) and initialization vector (iv.bin) from the script's parent directory into enc\images-enc.zip.
